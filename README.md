# EzCode
a simple script engine based off of python, made for top simplicity.
But How Do You Even Install EzCode?
# Installation process (windows only)
*step 1*: install python (REQUIRED DEPENDENCY), you can install python from the official website or the microsoft store (reccomended version: 3.13.x since 3.14.x is not supported yet)

*step 2*: install pygame (ALSO A REQUIRED DEPENDENCY), you can install pygame by: downloading python, opening powershell and type in ||pip install pygame||

*step 3*: download the .zip file from the releases tab, please install the latest versions for the best experience

*step 4*: extract it directly on your C: drive, important note: here's how the directory should look like "C:\EzCode\main files\Examples4EzCode\secondary examples"

*step 5*: this is a very important step, open the main directory, then the Examples4EzCode folder, from there right click any of the ".ez" files and click open with, choose "browse app on this computer" and go to the directory "C:\EzCode\" there you should double click "launcher.bat". That is the file you need to open, that will open a CMD window which will then show you a window for your script execution

*step 6* (optional): download the testing files for EzCode from the releases tab and open all the files, one by one to see if your installation was correct.

but how do you even use EzCode,

# Usage

EzCode is designed for top simplicity, so while making it i say, hmm why not just make 1 command the most powerful one?

*set* is the most important command in the entirety of the engine, before we get there, let's start from the top and easy

*Text Interface Format"

how to use the text interface format?

at the start of each script in EzCode you have to set the format (that is due to an unfixable bug), to set a text interface format start the script by writing "Text", after that you jump a line or 2, and write "loop-loopname" to start a loop, anything before the loop is considered setup. To display any text you have to write  "say ("specified text")"  

An example of a text script is:

\|/

Text

loop-Hello

say ("Hello, World!")

/|\

The EzCode contruibuters have realised that this might be too many lines, but this format truely simplifies more complex projects, especially graphical interface format files
